# Backtesting and Financial Analysis Library

This directory (`lib/`) contains the main modules and submodules for performing backtesting, data analysis, and forecasting models. Below is a description of each subfolder and its role in the system.

## Structure of `lib/`

### 1. `auxiliares/`
This module contains auxiliary functions and support tools to facilitate common operations within the system. It includes utilities for data processing, statistical calculations, and other general-purpose functions that are not specifically tied to other modules.

### 2. `backtest/`
The core of the backtesting functionality resides in this module. Here, algorithms and methodologies are implemented to evaluate investment strategies on historical data, including:
- Generation of performance metrics.
- Implementation of various strategy evaluation techniques.
- Tools for visualizing backtesting results.

### 3. `data/`
This module is dedicated to input data management. It provides tools for loading, cleaning, and transforming historical data on prices, volumes, and other relevant factors. This module is essential for preparing data before applying backtesting and forecasting models.

### 4. `dicts/`
This folder contains predefined dictionaries and data structures to facilitate information organization within the system. These dictionaries may include mappings of variables, strategy configurations, and other parameterizable elements.

### 5. `forecast/`
The forecasting module includes implementations of predictive models that can be used to anticipate future movements in the market. The models here can range from simple statistical approaches to machine learning models, all adapted to provide trading signals or inputs to backtesting algorithms.

### 6. `volatilidades/`
This module contains specific methods for calculating and analyzing market volatility. It includes different volatility estimation models, which can be used as inputs for trading strategies or in evaluating the risk of a strategy.

## Usage Instructions

Each subfolder has its own set of scripts and files that can be used independently or in conjunction with other modules. Be sure to correctly import the modules according to the requirements of your specific analysis or backtesting.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries specified in the project's main file (see `requirements.txt` or configuration files)

To execute the backtesting and analysis, refer to the main file `main.py` in the root directory, which coordinates the modules in this folder.

## Additional Notes

This module is under continuous development. It is recommended to review the documentation of each function or submodule to understand any updates and improvements made.
